There are some basic commands to learn, but first things first - some motivational stuff:

You can create a file manually using regular **Explorer** of your operational system, or you can do it via **Visual Studio Code**, for example.
Now you can work with **Terminal**


Alright, there is a couple of commands to start:
* **git init** - инизиализация git в репозитории
* **git add *"file name"*** - слежение за файлом со стороны Git
* **git commit *"file name"*** - коммит (сохранение шага) в каком-то его виде
* **git status** - отслеживание текущего статуса программы git 

Important to note, that to create a commitment you have to save file beforehand.

>It may be done using ***Ctrl + S*** Keyboard shortcut

When you have created a lot of versions of your program, you can switch between them using "key", that's provided by the program itself.

If you want to switch to a previous version of the file, you can use the following command:

- **git checkout *"key"*** - возвращение к версии программы с соответствующим "ключом"

Today i learned to use **Markdown** to create something-something. This small manual was prepared using the following guide:
